Seven Distro App Documentation

## Overview

The **Seven Distro App** is a modern web application built using the Laravel framework, leveraging Breeze for authentication, Inertia.js for modern single-page application features, React for building user interfaces, TypeScript for type safety, TailwindCSS for styling, and MySQL for data persistence. This project aims to provide a robust platform for managing and deploying a distribution application with an intuitive user experience.

## Technical Specifications and Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **Backend Framework**: Laravel
- **Authentication**: Laravel Breeze
- **Frontend Framework**: Inertia.js + React
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Database**: MySQL

### Architecture Overview

The architecture of the Seven Distro App is based on a traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

1. **Models**: Define the data structure and interact with the database. Laravel Eloquent ORM is utilized for database operations.
2. **Views**: Handle the frontend using Inertia.js, which allows React to be used as a view layer seamlessly.
3. **Controllers**: Serve as intermediaries between models and views, handling user requests and returning appropriate responses.

### Data Flow

1. The user interacts with the React frontend.
2. Inertia.js translates these interactions into API requests to the Laravel backend.
3. The Laravel controllers process these requests, interacting with the database via models.
4. Responses are sent back to the frontend, updating the UI dynamically.

## Installation/Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zenn1104/seven-distro-app.git
cd seven-distro-app
```

### Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate to the backend directory and install PHP dependencies.

```bash
composer install
```

### Step 3: Create and Configure .env File

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file and configure your database settings.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your database credentials:

```plaintext
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

### Step 4: Generate Application Key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### Step 5: Run Database Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 6: Install Frontend Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend directory and install Node.js dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 7: Compile Assets

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 8: Run the Development Server

Start the Laravel server.

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage Examples

### User Registration

To register a user, you can navigate to the registration page, which is accessible via the `/register` route. Fill in the required fields (name, email, password) and submit the form.

### Fetching Data Using React Component

Below is an example of how to fetch and display data using a React component.

```typescript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const DataDisplay: React.FC = () => {const [data, setData] = useState<any[]>([]);useEffect(() => {const fetchData = async () => {const response = await axios.get('/api/data-endpoint');setData(response.data);};fetchData();}, []);return (<div><h1>Data List</h1><ul>{data.map(item => (<li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>))}</ul></div>);
};
```

## API Endpoints

### User Authentication

- **POST /api/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/login**: Authenticate a user.
- **POST /api/logout**: Log out the authenticated user.

### Data Handling

- **GET /api/data-endpoint**: Fetch data from the server.
- **POST /api/data-endpoint**: Submit data to the server.

---

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Database Credentials**: Ensure your `.env` file contains the correct database configuration to avoid connection errors.
2. **Missing PHP Extensions**: If you encounter errors related to missing PHP extensions, ensure all required extensions in your `php.ini` file are enabled.
3. **Node Modules Issues**: If you face issues with npm, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again.

### Debugging Tips

- Use `php artisan serve --verbose` for detailed error logs.
- Inspect the network tab in your browser's developer tools to trace API requests and responses.

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes and collaborate effectively.
2. **Code Comments**: Include comments in your code to explain complex logic.
3. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use a consistent naming convention for your variables, functions, and components to enhance readability.
4. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly check for updates to your dependencies to ensure security and performance improvements.
